      "message": "Yes, this is because each reproxy instance is scoped to a single output directory as we do not support multiple reproxy instances using the same cache directory at the same time which could happen if we had a shared cache dir. The reproxy.creds file is very small so I dont think this is a problem",

      "message": "`reproxy.creds` does not prevent users from having to reauthenticate. It just stores a token for up to 1 hour so that we dont have to call `gcloud auth print-access-token` or the loas cred exchange as often, this saves 1-5s on subsequent builds. \nIf the user is already logged in and their reauth has not expired `gcloud auth print-access-token` or the loas cred exchange will just return the access token with no auth flow.\nSo each for each build directory `gcloud auth print-access-token` or the loas cred exchange will need to be run once per hour. This should not be a problem. \nThe reauth flow is only triggered by gcloud when we call `gcloud auth print-access-token` AND reauth has already expired (so after 20h), for loas we call `gcert` only if the credential exchange returns an auth error.",
