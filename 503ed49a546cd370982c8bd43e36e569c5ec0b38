      "message": "1、How exactly you\u0027re using this?\nLike issue 329781388 says, I only set a GIT_CACHE_PATH environment variable to enable it in Win OS.\n2、About \"the migration should be done carefully to not affect the existing builders\":\nI will provide a minimal implementation to support ssh_url later. But I have a doubt: Why does the return value of \"CacheDirToUrl\" discard \".git\"? For example, the cache folder name is: chromium.googlesource.com-chromium-src, and its return value is https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src, is obviously not a legal git_url. The reason may be that other code only uses part of the return value to determine, such as the only place where it is used (gclient_scm.py:773):\n```\ngit_cache.Mirror.CacheDirToUrl(current_url.rstrip(\u0027/\u0027)) \u003d\u003d git_cache.Mirror.CacheDirToUrl(url.rstrip(\u0027/\u0027))\n```\n\nSo, we will submit two parts of the changes, is this OK?\n1) Provide a minimal implementation to support ssh_url. Obviously at this stage, even internal builders use git_url in https form, so the https part will not be affected.\n2) Correct CacheDirToUrl to return a legal Git_URL, like: https://google.com/username/repository.git or git@google.com:username/repository.git\n\nLooking forward to your reply, thank you.",
