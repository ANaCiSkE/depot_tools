      "message": "I don\u0027t know if this is the best mechanism for this purpose.\n\nPersonally, I would prefer it if we just don\u0027t use \"-log-level warning\" in this script and show the output of CIPD if it has to install updates. I assume that the intent here was that we don\u0027t want the output of wrapper scripts (which also tend to call \"cipd_bin_setup\" before they execute their wrapped tool) to be contaminated with CIPD messages. Is that the case, and is it really important? I don\u0027t know.\n\nIf that\u0027s the reason behind the `-log-level warning` and we want to keep it, what about making a distinction:\n- If \"update_depot_tools\", which is what most users will use when they update depot_tools, runs, we run \"cipd ensure\" without \"-log-level warning\", so users get good progress updates about the running installations. This should be fine, because \"update_depot_tools\" already prints a message itself.\n- For cases where cipd_bin_setup gets called by wrapper scripts, we hide the output as we do now.\n\nWDYT?",
