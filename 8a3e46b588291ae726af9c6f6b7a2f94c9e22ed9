It would seem undesirable for us to inadvertently fork 3p Rust crates just by formatting their code with, for instance, a different version of rustfmt).",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think this hard-coded version number is OK, even temporarily. I\u0027d expect us to roll the Rust version fairly often and we don\u0027t want to have to rev depot_tools each time.\n\nEither we need to fix the path to rustfmt (first step is https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/3188213) or, failing that, this CL needs to figure out the right version number. As we discussed, it\u0027s hard for depot_tools to rely on `gn` so - failing all else - I think this CL should list this directory and pick whatever version is found.\n\nAnother option would be to list the currently active version in a file within the Chromium source tree.",
