Namely, concurrent recursive downloads of previously existing one may be corrupted otherwise + we assume time between uploads is much longer than time it takes to download.\n\nA more robust implementation would also check created timestamps of .ready file. Then, **in addition to above** abstain from pruning \u003cnumber\u003e* if \u003cnumber\u003e.ready is more recent than say 1 day.",
