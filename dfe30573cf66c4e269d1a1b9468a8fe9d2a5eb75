If we don\u0027t know the path we don\u0027t know exactly which API we\u0027re hitting and performance will be different per command I\u0027m sure. It might, similar to the higher level metrics be good to know what flags/options/keys were passing even if we don\u0027t know their values?\n\nIf we go to that level of information then yes, lets reprompt, or at least ask more widely if that is necessary.",
