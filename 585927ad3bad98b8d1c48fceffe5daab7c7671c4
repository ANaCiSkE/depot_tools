      "message": "@jdonnelly@chromium.org as FYI\n\nI don\u0027t have any CLs in mind at the moment... two things I am curious about though:\n1. How would conflicts in the middle of the chain be handled? Would it allow the creation of a cherry-pick with conflict markers? Would it stop at the first conflict?\n2. Assuming it stops at the first conflict... would you be able to resume building the chain of cherry-picks after fixing the conflict?",
