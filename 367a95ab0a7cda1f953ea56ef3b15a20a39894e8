I\u0027d like to remove 404 from the default arguments, but that\u0027s changing functionality instead of just interface, so I didn\u0027t want to do that in this CL. (previously, ignore_404 defaulted to True).\n\nThe reason for ignoring 404s is that all of the \"DeleteFoo\" operations return 404 if the object has already been deleted. In a future CL, we\u0027ll remove 404 from the default and only pass it in from the DeleteFoo function calls.",
