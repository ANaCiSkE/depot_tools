      "message": "\"Hides\" in the sense that calling using `vpython` as a value for\n`python_executable` means that it may not be clear that you\u0027re not getting a regular python interpreter. If you want `vpython` to be invoked, you should\nprobably have to ask for it.\n\nA similar bit of code in gclient has caused some confusion in bringing up\nthe Mac/ARM port (where supposedly python-invoking runhooks actually need \nvpython to work).\n\nUsing vpython *as* vpython and specifying the dependencies is fine +/-\nwhatever level of dependency-sharing you\u0027re willing to tolerate.",
