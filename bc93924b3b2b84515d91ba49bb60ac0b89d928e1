Does that mean that existing code was already relying on the presence of the VPYTHON_BYPASS environment variable on Windows, when in reality it did not actually exist during the time the code was written? IIUC, reverting this CL just silences a much larger problem instead of fixing it.\n\nEDIT: Resolved in https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d1308393#c7",
