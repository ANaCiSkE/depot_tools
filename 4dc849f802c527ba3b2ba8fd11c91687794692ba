      "message": "The current implementation matches Google\u0027s internal implementation (see go/owners). Keep things consistent with that has been a strong goal.\n\nI can see cases where including a per-file rule would be useful, but I can also see cases where it might be unexpected.\n\nE.g., You might have:\n\n//components/foo/OWNERS:\nfile://mojo/GOOD_MOJOM_REVIEWERS\n\n//mojo/GOOD_MOJOM_REVIEWERS:\nper-file *.mojom\u003drockot@chromium.org\n\nAnd that seems sensible.\n\nHowever, we\u0027ve usually structured that as:\n\n//components/foo/OWNERS:\nper-file *.mojom\u003dfile://mojo/GOOD_MOJOM_REVIEWERS\n\n/mojo/GOOD_MOJOM_REVIEWERS:\nrockot@chromium.org\n\nIt\u0027s possible that the former might be somewhat more flexible than the latter. However, I think supporting both would potentially be harder to use and isn\u0027t probably worth it as the result.\n\nI don\u0027t know why Google doesn\u0027t support this feature, but I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if their reasoning was similar.",
