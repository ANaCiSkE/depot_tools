Line 1640 returns and I don\u0027t think the else will be executed (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7442133/try-else-with-return-in-try-block).\n\nI would suggest moving the return statement to after the \"if sink\" block that starts on 1747. Also remove the else on this line since it\u0027s redundant with the raise in the except block.",
