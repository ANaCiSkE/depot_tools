This seems like a good idea (vpython startup times are quite slow, I believe) but should be acknowledged in the commit message to make it clear whether it is intended or not.\n\nAlso, the commit message says what is being changed, but not why. A sentence of context would be good. In particular, I seem to remember that this has been tried before and failed. If so, why will it succeed this time?",
