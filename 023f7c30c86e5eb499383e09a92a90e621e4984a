      "message": "Edward, this CL implements a way for users to trigger RTS-enabled Quick Runs from git cl. But Andrii correctly pointed out that RTS isn\u0027t relevant to all git cl users, since RTS / quick run is only set up for Chromium at the moment. He offered to set up a CQ API and call that from here to make this tool aware of the new Quick-Run label for any applicable CLs (ie all chromium/src CLs). This would come with its own set of tradeoffs. Wondering what your thoughts are.",
