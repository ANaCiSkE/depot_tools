      "message": "This is an occasionally-handy tool for identifying why the build is serialized. I kinda wanna have it available all the time, so depot_tools would be nice. But if nobody else is going to use it then it is just clutter.\n\nIt could also go in chromium\\tools\\win, where clutter is less of a concern, and I\u0027m actually leaning towards that. Thoughts?\n\nSimilar calculations go for ninjatracing. I\u0027d like to make it more accessible by copying it to depot_tools or chromium and having a batch file to invoke it. In both cases depot_tools is arguably more logical (nothing Chromium specific) but... clutter.\n",
