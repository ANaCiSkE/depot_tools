      "message": "It\u0027s not totally clear what is expected/best. I can see the advantages in raising an error if a user specifies too large a pool size so that they can fix their code. But, on the other hand, that would likely mean that somebody with a \"normal\" workstation would land some code and then somebody with a monster workstation would have to fix it.\n\nSo, pragmattically, especially in the closed-context of Chrome, I think that silently capping to 56 makes sense. And, 56 is plenty high enough that it is already probably beyond the point of diminishing returns.",
