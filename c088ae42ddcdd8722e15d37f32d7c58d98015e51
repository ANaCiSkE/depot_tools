      "message": "It will only produce the same diff if relative paths are passed to git diff. If absolute paths are used, the output here is expected, with src/dst path like `\"a/C:\\\\absolute\\\\path\\\\here.txt\"`. (the diff on L154 is what you\u0027d get if you ran the same git diff command on linux).\n\nThis test (and _process_diff) use absolute paths since AFAIK there isn\u0027t a way to specify two different `--relative` directories (one for non-git ws and another for download dir)",
