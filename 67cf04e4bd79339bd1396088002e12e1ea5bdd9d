Post fetching, this can be configured into .gclient file (say by passing a flag to the fetch script maybe). I feel like there must be definitely a better way to do this.",

      "message": "I\u0027m trying allow `git rebase-update` to work with arbitrary repos, not just repos like Chromium that have `origin/main` as the upstream branch, since it\u0027s a very useful command and works better than `repo rebase`.   I\u0027d like to upstream a fix, rather than maintaining a branch with these changes locally.\n\nI\u0027m far from a git expert, and I\u0027m certainly not a depot_tools expert, so I\u0027m open to suggestions for the best approach to achieve that.",

      "message": "@sokcevic I\u0027m thinking we could have an optional config within fetch_config where the user can store the default branch, which we could write to .gclient (similar to what we do with protocol_override) and if that\u0027s present, simply use that branch.\n\nThis doesn\u0027t seem like a case where we have to do this for all the repos to me.
