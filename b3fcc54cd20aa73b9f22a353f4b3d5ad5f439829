      "message": "Hello,\n\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/tools/depot_tools/+/4532006 has changed the exit code of `update_depot_tools` on ppc/s390x platforms as Goma is not supported and `goma_ctl.py` does not exist. This causes an early crash of the entire process which fails `fetch v8`.\n\nThis CL is exiting the process when running on said platforms. List of available Goma binaries can be found here:\nhttps://chrome-infra-packages.appspot.com/p/infra/goma/client\nwhich also make me wonder, how is Linux on Arm64 passing this process?",
