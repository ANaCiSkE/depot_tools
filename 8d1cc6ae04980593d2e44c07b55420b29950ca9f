      "message": "IMO it would be better solved at the gclient layer, or the DEPS layer (i.e. only pull those CIPD packages on specific supported architectures).\n\nThat said, Go 1.12 supports aix/ppc64, so maybe we can just add this to the (untested) target architecture list (though gclient is likely going to be downloading a bunch of binaries which don\u0027t actually apply to your platform).\n\nAs a workaround, I would recommend adding a small cipd script which does \u0027exit 0\u0027 to your $PATH ahead of depot_tools.",
