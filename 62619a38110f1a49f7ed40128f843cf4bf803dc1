If I want to upload changes based on top of this branch? If the latter, what would `git cl patch --force` do differently?\n\nNow that I found this CL and read the CL description, I understand it, but previously I didn\u0027t.\n\nI\u0027d either:\n- remove this message completely, it\u0027s mostly noise\n- say something like \"applied patch relative to current HEAD, use `git cl patch --force` to reset HEAD to patch base from gerrit before applying\" (which imho is both shorter and clearer)",
