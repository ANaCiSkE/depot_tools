If I want to upload changes based on top of this branch? If the latter, what would `git cl patch --force` do differently?\n\nNow that I found this CL and read the CL description, I understand it, but previously I didn\u0027t.\n\nI\u0027d either:\n- remove this message completely, it\u0027s mostly noise\n- say something like \"applied patch relative to current HEAD, use `git cl patch --force` to reset HEAD to patch base from gerrit before applying\" (which imho is both shorter and clearer)",

      "message": "Seems like the antecedent of \"that\" is pretty clearly \"upload changes based on top of this branch\".\n\nThe reason that I don\u0027t want to use a message like \"use git cl patch --force to reset HEAD to patch base from gerrit before applying\" is that it doesn\u0027t tell people *why* they\u0027d want to do that. It doesn\u0027t actually matter what --force does. What matters is that it lets you base new changes on top of someone else\u0027s change. That\u0027s why the message is phrased the way it is.",
