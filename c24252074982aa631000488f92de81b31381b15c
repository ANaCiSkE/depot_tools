      "message": "I do think there is room to improve this regex too. The recent bug was about a branch named fix-3d-something? Two ideas:\n\n(1) Exclude cases where the numbers are immediately followed by letters without some form of separator, e.g., _ or -\n\n(2) We could have a minimum number of digits needed to match a bug. What are the chances anyone is today fixing or referencing a bug with say... less than 4 digits?.. though maybe that doesn\u0027t hold for smaller projects like v8. So less likely to be a perfect test. Though single digits is probably safe to exclude?",
