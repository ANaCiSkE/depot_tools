      "message": "Is there any rush in landing this? The internal bug looks like the arm binary has already been around for a few days. If someone hits this, it\u0027ll cost them probably at least 15 min and maybe much longer to figure out what\u0027s up, while keeping this in for another year is roughly free (...right?).",

      "message": "There is no rush, but we could forget to revert it a year from now. Since the binary has been rolled out already, I believe it won\u0027t make a difference if we do it today or a year from now. And if there\u0027s a problem, we\u0027ll know it only when this lands so mind as well just to it now.\n\nI suppose there is a long term possibility that someone runs x86 version of git on M1; do you think that\u0027s a valid reason to have this around forever?",

The main places I\u0027d expect people to get git is either using the Apple-supplied copy or using a packaging system such as homebrew.\n\nIn other words, I\u0027m in favor of moving forward with this and just keeping in mind that we can roll back if we need to. Little bits of complexity add up, and the complexity reduction is appreciated.",
