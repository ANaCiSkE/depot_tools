      "message": "Is there any rush in landing this? The internal bug looks like the arm binary has already been around for a few days. If someone hits this, it\u0027ll cost them probably at least 15 min and maybe much longer to figure out what\u0027s up, while keeping this in for another year is roughly free (...right?).",

      "message": "There is no rush, but we could forget to revert it a year from now. Since the binary has been rolled out already, I believe it won\u0027t make a difference if we do it today or a year from now. And if there\u0027s a problem, we\u0027ll know it only when this lands so mind as well just to it now.\n\nI suppose there is a long term possibility that someone runs x86 version of git on M1; do you think that\u0027s a valid reason to have this around forever?",

      "message": "I don\u0027t know how that binary is deployed, but I could at least imagine that someone updates their depot_tools faster than getting that binary push, given how recent it is.\n\nAnd independent of the internal git binary, this seems like something that can save someone on a non-managed mac a bunch of time.\n\nIf it\u0027s expensive to keep around, let\u0027s toss it, but https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git/+log/refs/heads/main/cipd suggests that this file isn\u0027t edited all that often (10 times in the last 16 months since this was originally added), so maybe it\u0027s not very expensive.\n\nIn the end, up to y\u0027all of course.",
