If someone hits this, it\u0027ll cost them probably at least 15 min and maybe much longer to figure out what\u0027s up, while keeping this in for another year is roughly free (...right?).",

      "message": "There is no rush, but we could forget to revert it a year from now. Since the binary has been rolled out already, I believe it won\u0027t make a difference if we do it today or a year from now. And if there\u0027s a problem, we\u0027ll know it only when this lands so mind as well just to it now.\n\nI suppose there is a long term possibility that someone runs x86 version of git on M1; do you think that\u0027s a valid reason to have this around forever?",
