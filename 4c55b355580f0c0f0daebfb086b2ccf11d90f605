But I think what you need for the integration builder is a config that enhances the existing chromium config, similar to:\nhttps://cs.chromium.org/chromium/build/scripts/slave/recipe_modules/chromium/gclient_config.py?q\u003dshow_v8_revision\u0026sq\u003dpackage:chromium\u0026g\u003d0\u0026l\u003d104\n\nI also prefer not to add project specific stuff to the general depot_tools. This should be in chromium recipe module.",
