      "message": "Hmm. So I had missed that the presubmit (still) complained due to the various \"line too long\" warnings.\n\nThat is something we\u0027d have to resolve. My assumptions here:\n- we probably don\u0027t want to reformat more often than necessary (it looks like there\u0027s about a -8000/+10800 delta between pyink and yapf)\n- we will probably eventually support newer version of Python which yapf won\u0027t necessarily support\n\nBut while poking at this, I realized there\u0027s actually a third option for the short-term. Originally, I had thought it wasn\u0027t very practical to dynamically configure indents for yapf due to the complexity of searching for the config file. But it turns out we /already/ encapsulate that in git cl format here: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/tools/depot_tools/+/main:git_cl.py;l\u003d665;drc\u003dabf4847b0412cac3617c231af35f998eb9141748\n\nSo we could read the contents of .style.yapf and dynamically set it to 2 space indents if we detect preexisting 2 space indents in a file.",
