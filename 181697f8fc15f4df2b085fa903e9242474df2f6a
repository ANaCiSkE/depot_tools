This function seems a bit overloaded now that it\u0027s used in different contexts.\n\n2. It\u0027s a bit confusing to take a list of strings as arguments, compared to the simple \"what branch is this beign called for\" epecially if you always need to have an upstream_branch.  Maybe it should have arguments (self, upstream_branch, extra_diff_args\u003d[], use_cache\u003dTrue)?",
