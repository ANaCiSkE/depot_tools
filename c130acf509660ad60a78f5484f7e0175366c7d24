      "message": "This is incorrect; \"forbidden in Chromium\" is a significant overstatement.\n\nSpecifically in the ios/ subdirectory, it is *preferred* to only use #include in .mm files. The Chromium style guide merely says that we don\u0027t have to use #include for C++ headers, and the presubmit rule asks that newly added code (in //ios .mm files) just uses #import. \n\nThis is important because clang-format is used in many places both in and outside of Chromium where this guideline doesn\u0027t apply.",
