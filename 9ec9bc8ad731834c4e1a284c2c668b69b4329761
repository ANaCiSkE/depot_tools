      "message": "I can\u0027t speak for Darshan here, but originally this envvar was made as a way for users on unsupported platforms to bypass vpython. In python2 there probably wasn\u0027t a reason to do this on windows (because everything was python2.7), but I could imagine if someone was using some fresh copy of python3 (like 3.10) which we don\u0027t have wheels for, then they could run into a situation where they just want to \"do it themselves\"\n\nThat said; the actual `vpython` and `vpython3` binaries should always work correctly on windows, and those binaries should respect this envvar already; The reason that we added additional bypass support in the .sh files for not-windows was because some platforms were SO unsupported that we didn\u0027t even have a working `vpython` binary for them.",
