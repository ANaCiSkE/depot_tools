      "message": "That is the question. It should be the same everywhere.\n\n%scriptdir%python3.bat - more verbose but guarantees which python3 we get.\npython3 - simple, terse, and if they don\u0027t have a valid python3 in their path then there\u0027s nothing we can do about it.\n\nIt does seem that the more verbose option is futile because if they don\u0027t have a valid python3 in their path (before WindowsApps\\python3.exe) then the build is doomed anyway.\n\nSo, python3? Yes/no?\n\nIt\u0027s still on hold until python3 works from git bash, but we can at least be ready.",

There\u0027s a behavior difference - what\u0027s the motivation behind the change?\n\nArguments I can see...\n\nFor staying the same: It works today. Also, for consistency, note that autoninja (sh) calls python3 (sh), which on *nix is also resolved to the depot_tools/python3 via the PATH lookup.\n\nFor changing to explicit: You only *need* the bare `python3` if there\u0027s a scenario where you might inject a PATH entry to override python3, and that scenario may very well exist now or in the future.",
