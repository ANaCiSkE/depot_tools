      "message": "1) High Sierra (released 2017) is the first macos that shipped with python2. Do we need to support older OS?\n\n2) You are correct. If python2-bin is not in path, which is not part of official documentation, it won\u0027t work even with the latest version of depot_tools. This complicates this cl and we may need to have better approach. Depending on urgency of the bug, we may want to consider using python3. There are still scripts that run only on python2, but we can work on making them python3 compatbile.",

My Mojave machine at home does not have /usr/bin/python2, though my Catalina and Big Sur machines do, but I haven\u0027t checked older versions.\n\nWe definitely have Mac machines we have to support going back to at least 10.11, but I\u0027m not sure if we need *depot_tools* to work on them.\n\nThe doc I wrote up suggests that the right thing to do for *users* of depot_tools is to have them manually ensure that they have a `python` present in some directory in their path, but it doesn\u0027t actually say what the right thing to do for depot_tools scripts themselves is. `#!/usr/bin/env  python` might be the most portable thing to do if we have to support OS\u0027s that don\u0027t have a python3 or a python2 (which I think is true of older Mac OS\u0027s).",
