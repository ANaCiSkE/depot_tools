(And the same would probably be good for chrome-branch-committers in chrome-internal.)\n\nAlthough I\u0027m not sure I follow how \"creating the branch allows one person to unilaterally insert code into a release\". Code committed to a branch would still need to be rolled into DEPS, which would have to be approved, no?",
