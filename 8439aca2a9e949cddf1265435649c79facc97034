      "message": "This change stops users from starting a goma build when goma isn\u0027t running, a mistake that I (and others) make fairly frequently. It costs 150 ms (when goma is enabled).\n\nI don\u0027t know if I need to check anything else for rbe builds - do you know? I could make this check goma specific, leave it as-is, or have a different check for rbe builds but I don\u0027t know how they work or who uses them. Any ideas?\n\nNote: I have a separate change which should shave 600-700 ms off of auto_ninja.py by not using vpython.",
