      "message": "@iannucci@chromium.org @vadimsh@chromium.org Does the approach in this CL looks reasonable to you or is there a better solution? \n\nThe context is in http://b/355430412 where cipd putting all packages inside depot tools directory is hammering cog. http://b/355430412#comment2 suggests that we can write all cipd packages outside of cog workspace. Note that this is a depot_tools repo vendored inside chromium/src, not likely to be the one on $PATH. The cog initialization will use vendored depot_tools not the one on $PATH.",
