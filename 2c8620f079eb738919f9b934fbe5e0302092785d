      "message": "Hi Bruce. I wanted to add support to obtain the number of items in a PresubmitError so that I can assert the exact items in presubmit checks like this one: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/3705538/1/PRESUBMIT_test.py#4567, in which the current assertion is not very good.\n\nWhen calling errors[0].num_items in the linked above, I\u0027m getting this error:: \"AttributeError: \u0027PresubmitError\u0027 object has no attribute \u0027num_items\u0027\". If you think this is a nice addition, I welcome any help to make this work.",
