I recall that at the time I had found that simply dropping `\\r` and using `\\n` as the line ending afterwards worked everywhere.\n\nThis could have done the same; i.e. simply remove `\\r`, and don\u0027t pay attention to `\\n`.",

      "message": "Mac used to use \\r line endings (not \\n\\r) although I don\u0027t know how those interacted with the way that we read these files. Luckily OSX switched line endings to \\n so that they are compatible with POSIX/Linux/Unix.\n\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/439440/did-mac-os-lion-switch-to-using-line-feeds-lf-n-for-line-breaks-instead-of\n\nIt is amazing that there can be so much non-standardization around such a simple thing. It\u0027s nice that Windows\u0027 support for \\n line endings is improving - notepad handles them now!",
