      "message": "OK, I looked at this and the test, took a break, looked at it again, and I still don\u0027t really understand what it does. ðŸ˜… Especially the redirecting of three methods to mocks and then the `side_effect` part..\n\nIt\u0027s possible that I\u0027m just not used enough to the mock stuff in Python, so if another reviewer is fine with this, feel free to submit. Or if there\u0027s a simpler way that relies on less mocking, I can review and LGTM, too..",

      "message": "This is mockng too much. Why don\u0027t you let shutil.move and isfile do actual work, and just ensure the file is available in temp_dir post execution? It would be more like a integration test than unit test tho.\n\nAlternative would be to not create temp_dir in the first place, but that will require code refactoring, or even more mocking.\n\nI\u0027m okay work being done in a follow up cl or here.",
