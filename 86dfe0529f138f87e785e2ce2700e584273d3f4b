      "message": "This will be printed *each time* gsutil runs. Are you sure it is a good idea? Perhaps it should be moved to luci_login().\n\nMaybe it is also worth mentioning that this will make gsutil completely ignore default ~/.boto even when it is present. `luci-context context` overrides BOTO_CONFIG env var to point to a file that looks like this:\n\n```\n# Autogenerated by LUCI. Do not edit.\n\n[GSUtil]\nsoftware_update_check_period \u003d 0\nstate_dir \u003d \u003ctmp\u003e/T/luci2059406556/gsutil-luci-auth\n\n[GoogleCompute]\nservice_account \u003d default\n```\n\nThis is needed to make sure gsutil is picking up correct credentials (in particular on bots).\n\nIf callers had some options in their ~/.boto, they will be lost. If that\u0027s an issue, we\u0027ll have to teach `luci-auth context` to use the original ~/.boto as a starting point for creating the generated boto. Another alternative is to avoid `luci-auth context` and figure out how to use \"pluggable credentials\" with gsutil (see the comment I left in the doc).",
