      "message": "Okay, after chatting w/ you over IM, I think I understand this CL better. You\u0027re not really ignoring the deps_os entries, you\u0027re just not merging them in ParseDepsFile. And there isn\u0027t really a case where you want the user to set this flag, you just need it in order to be able to pass state around.\n\nSo, I suggest we change the flag to be named something really long and explicit, like --do-not-merge-deps-os-entries and add a comment or a help string saying that this isn\u0027t meant to be user-specified, if that all makes sense. argparse actually has a \"hidden\" flag for this purpose, but I don\u0027t think optparse does, unfortunately.",
