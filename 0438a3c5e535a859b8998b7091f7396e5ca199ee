      "message": "Using GitHub urls has the benefit that maintainers of Node can immediately start working and pushing commits in the checked out directory, otherwise I will have to explain why there is a mirror and how to set the url to GitHub in Node\u0027s docs.\n\nThis config is not going to run in Chromium\u0027s infra (the `node-ci` config already does the testing), and the maintainers of Node are very unlikely to use the mirror url, so setting up a mirror would not be very useful.\n\nBut I\u0027m fine using the mirror url if it is a hard requirement.
