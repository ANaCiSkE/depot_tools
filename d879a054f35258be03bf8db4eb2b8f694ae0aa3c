      "message": "I wrote autoninja to protect me from mistakes. One mistake was not specifying a large -j value when using goma. Fixed.\nThe other mistake is failing to start goma before doing a goma build (which causes O(1,000) failed compiles). This change checks for that case. Yay!\n\nBut, I don\u0027t know what to check for if rbe builds are configured. Is it still compiler_proxy.exe? Something else? Should I skip the checks in that case? Let me know.\n\nThis only handles Windows but I\u0027m okay with that.",
