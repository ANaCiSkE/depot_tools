      "message": "hi this CL has broken my workflow\n\n`use_goma can only be used for ChromeOS builds now. Use use_remoteexec\u003dtrue instead for other builds. ` error this morning\n\nI believed that b/316921158 was blocking the rollout of reclient, can this CL be reverted until this is fixed?\n\nIn the meantime I have done a local revert of this in my workspace but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a sustainable solution.\n\nThanks!",
