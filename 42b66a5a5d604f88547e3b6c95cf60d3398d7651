This will require significant changes to CIPD guts (since CIPD needs to track what files belong to what package, so it can clean them up when the package is removed or updated, this tracking currently assumes of version of a package per directory).",

      "message": "Ah, yeah I didn\u0027t think of this. It doesn\u0027t quite apply in depot_tools as is because depot_tools extracts the version from the manifest and uses that to name the directory via -root... perhaps we could reduce some of the complexity by just manually specifying the directory name in the manifest with @Subdir.\n\nI think depot_tools wants to use the full name of the package in the directory to avoid clobbering files used by currently running python processes.",
