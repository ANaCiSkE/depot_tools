      "message": "Shebang shouldn\u0027t be used for non executable files, so I don\u0027t think this is a good way to solve linting based on py version. Also, 1.5 can\u0027t be used with py3.\n\nInstead, I would probably encourage use of 2.x version (probably 2.7) for py3 (or code that is py2 + py3 compatible, in case for libraries). PRESUBMIT can filter files based on allowlist / blocklist so users can set two GetPylint calls.",
