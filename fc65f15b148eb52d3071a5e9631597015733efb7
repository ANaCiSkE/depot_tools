You want to allow dependencies that have the same name as long as they have different packages, like the example in https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d812386, right? What am I missing about how this works?",

I tried to run \u0027gclient sync\u0027 in this way with the siblings checking returning False, and somehow the multiple packages could be checked out without issue. However technically the logic is incorrect as you said.\n\nDigging into it again, this verify_validity could simply return True to allow the multiple packages to be added in dependencies. Additionally, should change _flush_terminated_threads in gclient_utils.py to allow same thread item names for cipd.",
