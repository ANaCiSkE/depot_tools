By default (without delayed expansion), interpreter substitutes variable values right away. So if %ERRORLEVEL% was 0 _BEFORE_ if (), it is also 0 inside \u0027if\u0027, regardless of any calls there. \n\nI spend 3h trying to figure out this shit :( It is highly confusing...\n\nUsing !ERRORLEVEL! tells the interpreter not to expand anything until the statement is really executed.",
