      "message": "I know this is just a carry-over from the old version of this code, but I\u0027m very confused by the use of the name \u0027custom_deps\u0027 here. Custom deps are supposed to be things set in the .gclient file which override deps set in the actual DEPS files. But this appears to be a list of all sub-dependencies. Do you know why the heck this is seemingly mismatched?",

      "message": "Yes. gclient revinfo --snapshot is supposed to output a .gclient file that reflects the revision everything is checked out at. It\u0027s kinda like gclient flatten, but it produces a gclient file instead.\nI don\u0027t know why this exists, and would be surprised if someone uses this. I think we should have only gclient revinfo --snapshot or gclient flatten, but not both.",
