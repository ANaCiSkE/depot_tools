      "message": "Hi Josip,\n\nI noticed when using `git cl split` recently that the default for the `enable-auto-submit` flag is `True`, and the action is `store_true`. With that, I believe there is no way to disable `Auto-Submit` when using `git cl split`.\n\nI am proposing this change to instead have a `disable-auto-submit` flag for `git cl split`, so by default auto submit is enabled as before, but there will now be a way to disable it. What do you think?",
