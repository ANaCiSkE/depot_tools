This means that if I invoked autoninja like this:\n\n\u003e autoninja asdf \"asdf 1234\" 1234\n\nit gets passed to autoninja.py like this:\n\n\u003e python autoninja.py \"asdf \"asdf 1234\" 1234\"\n\nand somehow that gets erroneously translated into this:\n\n\u003e \"c:\\src\\depot_tools\\ninja.exe\" \"asdf asdf\" \"1234 1234\" -j 46",

      "message": "Even if ninja is started by people in Chromium, now ninja is a third party tool, which is used by various projects.  I do not think it feasible to add the feature specific to certain projects.\nAlso, we want to add more things to autoninja, and I do not think them meaningful to ninja itself.\n\nDirk also mentioned why autoninja etc in the other CL, and you may be also interested in that:\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/tools/depot_tools/+/1325267\n\n\nIf you think my code is too complicated, please see patchset 1 and discuss with other reviewers.  I think there is a trade-off between ease of generated command line and ease of generating command line.  I do not have strong opinions on which is better.",
