      "message": "I thought about splitting them out but I wasn\u0027t sure how much detail we actually have when setting this. Right now all of time outs, capacity issues, and test framework bugs get marked as INVALID_TEST_RESULTS so this is an incremented improvement.\n\nI could either split it now and try to do it in one go or I can add a TODO or bug to split this out further as a next step.
