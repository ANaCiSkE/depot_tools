      "message": "Ideally it returns a unique exit code if `git cl presubmit` itself fails vs. a check that it\u0027s running fails, and right now retcode 1 can mean both. WDYT about keeping 1 as \"git cl presubmit itself failed\" and adding 2 as \"git cl presubmit ran fine, but got some presubmit errors\" and 3 as \"git cl presubmit ran fine, but got some presubmit warnings\"?\n\nIf we decide to change the exit codes, we\u0027ll also need to check/update the presubmit recipe module section here: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/tools/depot_tools/+/main:recipes/recipe_modules/presubmit/api.py;l\u003d178-192;drc\u003d0696c428b04513254d3b3e0b1fba5e5afdb11cf4",

      "message": "That generally sounds good. For the recipe modifications, would that just be changing `if retcode \u003d\u003d 0:` to be `if retcode in (0, 2, 3):` instead, or are there other changes that need to be made?",

      "message": "Yeah, we\u0027d need to make sure the retcode gets classified correctly as success/failure/infra_failure, so also something like changing https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/tools/depot_tools/+/main:recipes/recipe_modules/presubmit/api.py;l\u003d187;drc\u003d0696c428b04513254d3b3e0b1fba5e5afdb11cf4 to fail on 2.\n\nAlso something that @ddoman@chromium.org had brought up was in the case this returns non-0, some Swarming tasks could be marked as infra failure instead of non-infra failure, but I\u0027m not confident how that would impact things down the line, especially with changes in the paragraph above",
