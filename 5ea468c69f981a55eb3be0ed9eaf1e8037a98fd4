If we assume it to be base_commit, it will include several changes that are not part of the CL.\n\nWe might also be applying a patch based on another branch than the one base commit is a part of.\n\nRight now we\u0027re guessing it to be one of the most common branches, or one of the remote branches available to the client, but this is a hack (see the deleted function above).",
