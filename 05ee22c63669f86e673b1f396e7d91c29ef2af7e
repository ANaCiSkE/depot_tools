      "message": "This might not be the best long term way to use `dirmd`, since it couples your recipes (ran on bots) to depot_tools (a kitchensink of tools thrown into developer\u0027s $PATH). This may be OK though -- hard to say w/o knowing your intended usage.\n\nDo you have a CL with expected usage? have you tested that CL with `led` tooL?\n\nAlso, I suspect you also need to modify .gitattributes to ensure dirmd entry shim is included:\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools/+/05ee22c63669f86e673b1f396e7d91c29ef2af7e/.gitattributes",

Depot_tools is a kitchensink, originally meant for manually-ran commands, not something with stability. I\u0027ve asked the question from martiniss@ on chromium/src CL.\n\n\u003e I can\u0027t use led at the moment due to crbug.com/1168315, but I\u0027ll run it before landing.\n\nhttps://crbug.com/1168315 was filed in generic \"Infra\" component. I\u0027ve triaged it to my team to see what\u0027s up.\n\n\u003e If I need to include the .gitattributes change, a led run would fail, right?\nYes, resulting build should fail with smth like dirmd not found.",
