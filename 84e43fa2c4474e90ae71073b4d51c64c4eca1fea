      "message": "I don\u0027t understand. Here\u0027s what I know: I guess git bash won\u0027t parse python.bat. It has the python.exe and python3.exe directories in depot_tools in its PATH environment variable, but \"which python\" and \"which python3\" both fail to find those installs. However invoking python finds the depot_tools python (confirmed with sys.executable) somehow.\n\nSo, somebody who understands this better needs to figure out why git bash can launch depot_tools python but not depot_tools python3. I don\u0027t see an alias, the path doesn\u0027t seem to be used, so, ???\n\nBTW, I slightly misattributed this. It was actually crrev.com/c/2631396 that changed line 8. But, same author/same issues so discussing here works I think.",
