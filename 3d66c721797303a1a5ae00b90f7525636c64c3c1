Although in a desired way*, it may modify some tests in the downstream repo.\n\nI updated the CL description and added Recipe-Manual-Change footer. I will submit it in 24 hour. Stop me if this is risky.\n\nMany thanks.\n\n*: if the given gerrit host is not valid, no need to initilize tryserver\u0027s property, e.g. gerrit_change.",
