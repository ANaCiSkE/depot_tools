I might try to move //build/gn_helpers.py to depot_tools, update mb.py, and refactor things in mb.py and mb_unittest.py to fix the complaint raised in GNArgsFromDir. But it\u0027d take a bit of experimenting if that was the best outcome. Cloning gn_helpers.py into depot_tools might also work. Fetching gn_helpers.py from a chromium/src checkout via gclient_paths (like gn.py does) is a third option.",
