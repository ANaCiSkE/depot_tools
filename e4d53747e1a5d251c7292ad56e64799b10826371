      "message": "The issue here is that we pull in a very old version of virtualenv to use in vpython, which includes a very old version of pip that is not aware of macOS 11 compatibility.\n\nUpgrading to a modern virtualenv is something that we definitely need to do, but will require thorough testing. It\u0027s not related to 2.7 vs 3 per se, since the latest virtualenv is still 2.7-compatible.\n\nThe reason I wanted to do a quick workaround here is to not put us in a position where the virtualenv upgrade blocks us from producing any new cpython packages that work on Big Sur, since we are seeing many developers starting to upgrade.",
