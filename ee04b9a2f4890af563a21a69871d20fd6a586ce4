No integers or anything else.\n\nWhen you try to do \n\n  gclient config \u003csomething\u003e --custom-var true_var\u003d\"0\"\n\nIt will just fail, because we\u0027re passing \u00270\u0027 to gclient_eval.EvaluateCondition (for some reason) and when it evaluates it, it gets an integer, which is not allowed.\n\nThe test is doing something like \n\n  \u0027gclient\u0027 \u0027config\u0027 \u003csomething\u003e \u0027--custom-var\u0027 \u0027true_var\u003d\"0\"\u0027\n\nSo now we pass \u0027\"0\"\u0027 to gclient_eval.EvaluateCondition, which then returns \u00270\u0027, which is what we set here.\nHowever, when we try to use true_var in a condition, we call EvaluateCondition again, \u00270\u0027 gets interpreted as an integer and we fail.",
