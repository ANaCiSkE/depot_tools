      "message": "Nit: I think we should not be allocating `git gerrit` \"namespace\", and that we should use `git cl cherry-pick` or something within git_cl.py realm. A good alternative is gerrit_client.py\n\nIt would also be good to check with dcheng@ if this would work for their workflows. It\u0027s easier to change interface now, vs once it lands and we get users.",
