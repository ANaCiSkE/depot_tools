      "message": "One concern about this change is that it encourages/enables packaging the VS toolchain on a machine that has multiple installs of VS. In an ideal world this wouldn\u0027t matter, but in practice there might be some cross-contamination, or some variation caused by having an ongoing (installed and then upgraded) version. That is, I\u0027ve usually done the install on a clean VM created for this purpose in order to increase the odds of reproducibility.\n\nOn the other hand, being able to test on your workstation is certainly handy, and maybe these cross-contamination fears are unfounded.\n\nAnother way to solve your problem would be to uninstall VS 2019. That\u0027s what I did a few days ago, \u0027cause I\u0027ve fully switched to VS 2022.\n",
