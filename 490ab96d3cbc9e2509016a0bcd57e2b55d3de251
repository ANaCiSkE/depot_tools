User wanted to check additional code in chromium/src in that path, resulting in overriding files retrieved from DEPS.\n\nThe problem is that we don\u0027t know what the right order is (e.g. should DEPS override the files, or not). Our tooling shouldn\u0027t allow users to add custom files if the directory is managed by DEPS, but we also don\u0027t have that much control since DEPS is not natively supported by Git/Gerrit",
