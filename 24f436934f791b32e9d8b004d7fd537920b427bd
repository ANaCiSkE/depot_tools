      "message": "Either works, it kinda depends on whether you care about it being exported to all subprocesses or just the one, as you say.\n\nI don\u0027t think you can (easily?) make the `FOO\u003dbar` part of `FOO\u003dbar baz` conditional, so you can\u0027t say something like `$NINJA_STATUS ninja ...`, which means that doing the \u0027part of the command line\u0027 part would require you to duplicate the command line, I think, which might be awkward given the rest of the script.",
