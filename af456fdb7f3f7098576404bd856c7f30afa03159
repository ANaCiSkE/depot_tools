Otherwise, this wouldn\u0027t work. What\u0027s the intent of `maxsplit\u003d1`? If the intent was to extract the path, then I think a different parsing function should be used.\n\ncrbug.com/1471241 reports an issue due to this issue. The output of `git submitmodule status` is like below.\n```\n5885d3c24833ad72845a52a1b913a2b8bc651b56 build (heads/main-2124-g5885d3c24)\n```\n \nIt results in `commit_hashes[\"build (heads/main-21214-abc)\"] \u003d \"...\"` at L950, and causes the exception at L981, the submodule name, from the output of `git config -l` does not contain the description.",
