      "message": "Curious. It looks reasonable, I guess, but the commit message needs to explain what RBE is, and should probably acknowledge that Chromium does not use the use_rbe flag at all.\n\nWhat downstream projects are setting use_rbe? That seems like an important detail so that future readers understand the context. Maybe a link to a project file that uses rbe?\n\nYou say \"goma is deprecated\" but I have not heard that. Citation needed.",

      "message": "Tried to clarify with the new commit message. It\u0027s specifically the goma *backend* that\u0027s deprecated; chromium can continue using the goma client frontend, but all projects now need to use an RBE backend. I recall asking the people working on the migration for Nest why we couldn\u0027t use the same strategy chromium is using and keep the same frontend, but I don\u0027t remember the answer clearly. I\u0027m just trying to get the minimum change we need upstream to keep the rest of our tooling working well ðŸ˜Š",
