      "message": "when people run `repo` in their CrOS checkout, they run the one in depot_tools.  that script is responsible for updating the .repo/repo/ copy in the checkout itself, and then executing that.  that\u0027s how new repo releases roll out without having to update depot_tools.\n\nafter this CL, when people run `repo`, it\u0027ll be this script that first updates depot_tools before running the repo launcher (which takes care of running the .repo/repo/ code).\n\nalthough i\u0027m going to tweak this logic after thinking more.  update_depot_tools isn\u0027t exactly cheap ... it seems to take almost 1 second in the nop case.  we also don\u0027t want to update on all operations, just `repo sync`.",
