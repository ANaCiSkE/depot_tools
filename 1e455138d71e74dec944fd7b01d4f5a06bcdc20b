      "message": "Seems like this check should happen in DependencyRun, but there is no way around this if we\u0027re keeping DownloadGoogleStorage() where it is.\n\nAlso alternatively, when non-git sources are fully supported, we could change this to check if we are in a cog environment, since we know gclient shouldn\u0027t be doing anything related to non-git sources in cog. Other gclient commands might need to be added here later, so we might be playing whack-a-mole. and technically having run() executed does not break anything in non-cider runhooks + revinfo.\n\nBut i think this the current change is preferable for now and long-term. Even regardless of cider, having DownloadGoogleStorage or CreatePackageIfNecessary run during `runhooks` isn\u0027t correct behavior.",
