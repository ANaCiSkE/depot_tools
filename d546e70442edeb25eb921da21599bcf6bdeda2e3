      "message": "In the script I wrote to do the initial tracing for dummy changes -- https://crrev.com/c/1545516 -- I captured some other stuff in addition to the packet trace, like the output of `git version --build-options` and `git config -l`, and the contents of ~/.gitcookies, that the GoB has requested in their bug-filling instructions.\n\nI feel like we should include that in our data as well, though I worry a bit that the git config data might include stuff a user might not want to upload or would be considered privacy-sensitive.\n\nThoughts?",
