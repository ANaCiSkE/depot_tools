      "message": "I don\u0027t actually understand what hierarchy() is supposed to do; the while loop on 1102 makes it difficult for me to understand what is going on is there supposed to be a +\u003d somewhere instead of an \u003d, maybe?\n\nAt least as far as flatten goes, what I think I want to see is which DEPS file produced each dependency or hook. Ideally, we\u0027d print this once for each *group* of dependencies (i.e., once per each DEPS file), rather than for each dependency. And, if I understand correctly, this routine will be called for each dependency? But, this might also be complicated by the ordering of dependencies and hooks, maybe?\n\nOTOH, maybe Michael and/or other consumers of flattened DEPS files would rather see a comment per dependency?",
