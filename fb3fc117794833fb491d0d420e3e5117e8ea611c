      "message": "Yeah, workarounds with things like /dev/stdout (although not cross-platform) are why I\u0027m not too worried about it. Supporting \"-\" might be nice, although I\u0027m not sure if there is precedent with gclient or depot_tools in general, so it might be confusing to have it here and not in other places. Not requiring it just seemed like the simplest \"least common denominator\" solution.",
