      "message": "Problem with this CL: https://github.com/bazelbuild/reclient/blob/main/internal/pkg/rbeflag/rbeflag.go#L52 means that flags defined on the environment take precedence over those set in the cfg files. Which means that after this PR the exec_strategy will always be racing, with no way to override it in the particular buildtools/reclient_cfgs/... files. This will affect anyone who builds Chromium anywhere. Was that the intention? It seems to me that changing the strategy in the config files is the safer way to go.",
