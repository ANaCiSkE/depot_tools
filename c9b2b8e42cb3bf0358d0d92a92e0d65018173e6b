      "message": "I got answer before in https://goto.google.com/chweib.\n\nI agreed to the answer because I do not have good experience with Python\u0027s subprocess module.\nIt brought non-fixable problem, which took my and my colleague\u0027s time (crbug.com/390764).\nIts face is something like Unix one but its behavior is completely different and that confused\nus a lot.  I recently saw it still works strange in:\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/tools/depot_tools/+/1166745\n\nThese are good reasons for me to leave the way to invoke ninja as-is.",
