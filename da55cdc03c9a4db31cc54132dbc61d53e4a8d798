      "message": "Yes, sorry if that wasn\u0027t clear. Although now that I look at it again, I think I have the parent logic wrong. Other areas that deal with parent vars give the highest precedence to the farthest parent (i.e. the root DEPS in a hierarchy of recursedeps), but this would allow nearer parents to potentially override values set at the root. Probably not a huge deal in practice, since we don\u0027t have a lot of multi-level recursedeps, or recursedeps with variable overrides, but I\u0027ll fix.",

      "message": "Actually, I\u0027m just confused. This does something like:\n\nDEPS.root: foo\u003dbar\nDEPS.recurse1: foo\u003dboo\nDEPS.recurse2: foo\u003dfar\n\nWhile processing DEPS.recurse2, this starts with foo\u003dfar. Then parent.get_vars() is called on DEPS.recurse1, which in turn calls parent.get_vars() on DEPS.root and gets foo\u003dbar, which overrides foo\u003dboo, and then overrides foo\u003dfar, so DEPS.recurse2 ultimately sees foo\u003dbar, which is what we want.  I\u0027ll just go back to vacationing and stop trying to think.",
