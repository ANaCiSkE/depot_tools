Ideally you want something that is lower priority than all foreground/user-initiated tasks, but higher than all other background tasks. Or something like that. Pragmatically, on a system that is otherwise mostly idle, as long as you lower the priorities \"a bit\" it should be fine (as long as you don\u0027t hit priority inversions) so I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s worth stressing over too much.",
