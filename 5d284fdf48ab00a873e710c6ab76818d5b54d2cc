      "message": "Did you mean to write encode instead of decode here?\n\nEven then, I\u0027m not sure this change actually does the right thing. It will take a byte, treat it as a Unicode code point, encode that using UTF-8, even if, in the original, the byte was followed by another byte for a complete but different Unicode code point.\n\nFor example, รก (code point U+00E1) would be encoded in UTF-8 as two bytes \"\\xc3\\xe1\". Treating these as two separate Unicode code points and encoding as UTF-8 would result in the four-byte string \"\\xc3\\x83\\xc2\\xa1\". That may or may not be what you intended.",
