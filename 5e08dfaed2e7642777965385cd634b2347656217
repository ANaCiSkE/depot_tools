      "message": "Upper-case S would look better. Maybe a period, although I\u0027m not sure that matters.\n\nWhy not check to see whether the .ninja_log file is empty? For siso builds it should be. I suspect the reason is that you have a leftover .ninja_log file, but the question then is why? autoninja checks for that and will not let you do a siso build without doing a gn clean because that isn\u0027t supported.\n\nWhich is to say, I guess checking for .siso_deps is fine, but it is revealing of something weird happening in your setup.",
