Depending on the severity of the problem it may make sense to fix the presubmits rather than the detection.\n\nAt the very least it would be great to get a link to the failing output.",

      "message": "Yeah sorry about the other revert, I did verify this one locally and it\u0027s the one blocking presumbit in several projects. I have no issue with your reasoning however it was landed as a breaking change without any notice to the projects it might affect. I filed https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id\u003d1330859 and assigned to you earlier which contain the info you want. I will update it to reflect the real culprit. I think we can reland https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/tools/depot_tools/+/3683378 .",
