      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is quite what we want, since pinning should always use an explicit hash. For instance, given:\nfoo.git@refs/heads/bar\n\nThe previous implementation would replace that with something like:\nfoo.git@refs/heads/bar@12345ABCDE\n\nThis change would accept any revision value as properly pinned, so just return:\nfoo.git@refs/heads/bar\n \nBut that\u0027s not really pinned, because the ref could change. The true pinned output should actually be:\nfoo.git@12345ABCDE\n\nSo I think it still has to check IsGitSha(), but if the revision isn\u0027t a proper hash, it has to replace it, not append to it, with a proper hash.",
