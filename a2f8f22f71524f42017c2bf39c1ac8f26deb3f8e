It\u0027s kind of awkward since the current builder output would have to be commits back into depot_tools (given the way depot_tools is both the source and distribution mechanism for the tools and docs). Maybe it would be possible to make the docs be a CIPD package which then gets unpacked at man/html and man/man1 though? Maybe?)",
