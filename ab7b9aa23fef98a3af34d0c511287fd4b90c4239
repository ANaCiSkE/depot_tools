      "message": "That\u0027s a good point. I suppose it wouldn\u0027t be resolved to HEAD in that case, but definitely worth verifying. Do you happen to know an easy way to find such builds or should I make a merge conflict in release-branch in order to test it?\n\nAs for this fix, this is needed because recipe roller calls bot_update for upstream and downstream repo. Branch is always HEAD, and cl is then inspected. However, cl shouldn\u0027t looked if is not triggering repository. I\u0027ll add this to description on next update.\n\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/infra/infra/+/master:recipes/recipes/recipe_roll_tryjob.py;l\u003d191",
