Generally, PRESUBMIT operates in two stages:\n1) Collect the series of checks/tests to run.\n2) Pass them to a test runner, which runs them in parallel.\n\nI pointed you to CheckCIPDManifest, which operates this way. Do you see an advantage to not using this methodology here? I\u0027d prefer that you return a list of \"input_api.Command\" for consumption along with all of the other tests.",
