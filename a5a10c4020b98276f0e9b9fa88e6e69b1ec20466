      "message": "Actually I think the reviewers thing is WAI: owners_client.py\u0027s optimization function isn\u0027t strictly about minimizing reviewer count, but a score function based on how \u0027close\u0027 an OWNER is too. That works well for most cases, but can also somewhat defeat the point of --max-depth.\n\nI will look into adding another option (yes, I know) to minimize reviewers to owners_client.py and git_cl.py in a followup. In the meantime, this is still useful for providing a bit more control over the granularity of splits.",
