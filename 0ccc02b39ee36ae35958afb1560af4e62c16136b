I could make it handle both versions but it\u0027s probably fine to just wait until we finally completely drop py2 support.\n\nThat said, we have already dropped py2 support in the context of presubmits - crrev.com/c/4328470 and crrev.com/c/4522480 mean that any usage of Python 2 in the presubmit system would be causing failures.",
