      "message": "The recipe roll into the Skia infra repo is failing because of this.  We have autoroller integration tests which run roll-dep inside of a recipe, using depot_tools from a recipe bundle.  That bundle does not include update_depot_tools (I\u0027m not sure why, but we definitely don\u0027t want to be changing the depot_tools rev when running roll-dep).  Can we do one of the following?\n\n1. Change this to [\u0027python\u0027, \u0027gclient.py\u0027, \u0027root\u0027] which would bypass update_depot_tools.\n2. Refactor a bit so that we can just call into shared code to obtain the root dir, rather than creating a subprocess.\n\nThanks!",
