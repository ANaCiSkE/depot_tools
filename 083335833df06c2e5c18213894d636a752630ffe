      "message": "Seems like this whole function should be contained in gerrit_util, and use the chromium-review.googlesource/project/project%2Aname/config API instead of using git fetch. But that certainly has different latency characteristics, and should be investigated as an independent change.",

      "message": "I actually considered that. Latency should actually be better (worst case) than 5+ minutes long git fetch op, as reported by primiano@.\nBut the downside is potentially wrong cookies for chromium-review.googlesource.com vs chromium.googlesource.com and since this is for Rietveld, I am not convinced this is worth the trouble.",
