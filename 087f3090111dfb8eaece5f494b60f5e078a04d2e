      "message": "The checks are in place as we don\u0027t test nor provide binaries for unsupported systems. So, while `fetch` and `gclient` work when invoking with python installed on the system, it may not work with `vpython3 fetch` (ie not all cipd python wheels may be available for freebsd). I believe the decision to fail fast is made intentionally, but I don\u0027t have historical knowledge.\n\nSince I don\u0027t have FreeBSD, could you check if all unit tests pass under it (using vpython3)? If all is green, we could explicitly allow FreeBSD.",
