      "message": "`subprocess2` has an interesting bug in windows. When trying to write a multi-line value with it, it only writes one line, hence failing the test.\n\nAs for a quick fix, I decided it\u0027s better to have a test with direct subprocess over waiting for subprocess2 to be fix (or even removed since we have successfully deprecated py2). Any concerns? @sokcevic@chromium.org",

      "message": "Interesting. When I wrote the initial test case with subprocess2, writing `line 1\\nline 2\\nline 3` only wrote line 1. I initially thought maybe this was because of windows line separator differences but when I tested directly on powershell and with plain subprocess this doesn\u0027t occur.\n\nI will go ahead and submit this fix to unblock them and then look into the bug.",
