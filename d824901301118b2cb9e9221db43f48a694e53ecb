      "message": "`subprocess2` has an interesting bug in windows. When trying to write a multi-line value with it, it only writes one line, hence failing the test.\n\nAs for a quick fix, I decided it\u0027s better to have a test with direct subprocess over waiting for subprocess2 to be fix (or even removed since we have successfully deprecated py2). Any concerns? @sokcevic@chromium.org",
