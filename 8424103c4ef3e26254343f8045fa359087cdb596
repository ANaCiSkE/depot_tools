      "message": "First of all, I wish we could enforce use_relative_paths everywhere.\n\nThis is confusing, but I could see why effective cwd was actually gclient root dir and not its parent project itself.\n\nMy understanding is that if use_relative_path is set to False, as it is here, then the expectation is that cwd \u003d gclient root regardless if it is a recursedeps or not.\n\nI didn\u0027t find a test case where we have the following dependencies:\n\nfoo (use relative \u003d True) -\u003e foo/bar (use relative \u003d False) -\u003e foo/bar/zzz (doesn\u0027t matter what use_relative is).\n\nI would expect: \"foo\" to have \"bar\", and \"bar\" to have \"foo/bar/baz\" since it uses use_relative_paths\u003dFalse.",
