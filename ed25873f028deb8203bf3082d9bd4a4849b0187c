      "message": "I believe that only happens when you read the config value as bool. But the behavior before https://crrev.com/c/5280779 reads the config value as text. Therefore, I think it\u0027s possible \"False\" is returned so if somebody set `gclient-auto-fix-url` to False in the config, the code actually works. That said, I do suspect this is an under-used feature. So I think it might be fine completely remove the support and see who\u0027s complaining given it\u0027s hasn\u0027t been working correctly since Feb 2024.",
