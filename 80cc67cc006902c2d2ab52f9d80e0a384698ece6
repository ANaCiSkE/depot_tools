      "message": "This seems like a hack that adds extra maintenance for us (the chops source team) as owners of depot_tools. While it is small, CLs like this add up quickly to a code-base that already has a lot of code debt and very low test coverage.\n\nFor the default no-squash behavior, we think that would be a good change that will definitely be beneficial to enough users. But given that it is not a p0, I don\u0027t think this hack is necessary over doing it properly with tests. \nI have filed a p3 crbug.com/1431969 for this that anyone can take if they have extra cycles. If you disagree with the priority please let us know.\n\nFor adding a --no-squash arg, afaik, there have been no other requests for it, and we want to be strict on what args we add to depot_tools commands to avoid having the codebase littered with args used by just ~1 developer each. Please file a bug, or let us know if there is already a bug that would help use gauge what its usage would be.\n\nIn the meantime, I\u0027m reverting this change.",
