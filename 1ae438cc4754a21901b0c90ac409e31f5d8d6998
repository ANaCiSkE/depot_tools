See the discussion on https://crrev.com/c/2881916 where thakis@, ehmaldonado@ and I went back and forth on whether it was better to rewrite \u0027python3\u0027 to \u0027vpython3\u0027 or just specify \u0027vpython3\u0027 as the caller; we decided on the latter.\n\nAlso, maybe I missed something, but it doesn\u0027t seem like setup-gn.py needs vpython?",

      "message": "Understood.\n\nNo, setup-gn.py does not need vpython but was run through vpython previously (due to the existence of the rewriting rule). I was unsure whether we wanted all hooks to run under vpython or not and this is why I made this change.\n\nGiven the discussion in https://crrev.com/c/2881916, I think we prefer when hooks explicitly opt in into vpython3, so it was probably not intended to run setup-gn.py via vpython.\n\nThank you for the quick answer.",
