If it\u0027s actually 1.16 times faster then you should say \"2.16 times as fast\" to make that clear.\nhttps://randomascii.wordpress.com/2018/02/04/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-performance/\n\nYou should also say something about \"Testing on Windows shows that this makes a NOP \"gclient sync --nohooks\" run roughly three times as fast.\"\n\nIt went from around 11.3 s to around 3.7 s. Wow. Amazing.",
