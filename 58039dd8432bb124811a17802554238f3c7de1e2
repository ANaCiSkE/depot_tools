The limit of 500 jobs was recently removed and this causes build failures on some of my team members (surprisingly those with the most powerful Intel mac machines, 18-core iMacPro).\n\nI\u0027ve tested that a limit of 800 works on all machines I have access to, so it should be fine for people with those 18-cores iMacPro (even if this decreases the number of jobs per cpu).",
