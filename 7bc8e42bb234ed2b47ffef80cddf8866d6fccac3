      "message": "There is at least one use, in third_party/devtools-frontend-internal/PRESUBMIT.py. That has been upgraded in the remote repo (https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/devtools-frontend/src/PRESUBMIT.py;l\u003d43;bpv\u003d1) but still references python_executable in the Chromium copy.\n\nIt looks like the original intent was for python3_executable to be temporary but I\u0027m not sure there\u0027s much benefit in renaming the 59+ uses of python3_executable back to python_executable.\n\nGiven how hard it has been to root out hidden use of Python 2, I\u0027m not sure there is any benefit in removing python_executable. Deleting it might cause breakages, and there is no real cost to leaving it.",
