      "message": "Added initial support for starting/stopping reproxy.  I was kinda up in the air about doing it this way, or adding the capability to specify a setup hook (and a teardown hook), which would just point to a script (or in this case, the two bootstrap commands).  In that case it could be used for other setup/teardown stuff, if needed.\n\nAnyway, thoughts are apprecaited.\n\nThanks!",
