I always get that backwards :).\n\nLooking at https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/?modelList\u003dMac-mini-2018,Mac-mini-M1,Mac-mini-M2, I think it says that the ARM-based Minis have always had at least 8 cores. Some (all?) of the x86-based minis might\u0027ve been fewer, I\u0027m not sure how old our machines are.\n\nI guess I\u0027m not sure why we\u0027re using a minimum of 8 cores. Why not just stick to `gclient_utils.NumLocalCpus()`?",
