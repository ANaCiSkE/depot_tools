      "message": "So one option I can think of that won\u0027t be Chromium-specific is to generalize this in some way - i.e. to allow a repository to contain something like a FORMAT.py file at its root (similar to PRESUBMIT.py) - and for this code to delegate the validation to that, if it exists. Then, this logic can exist in that file instead. What do you think? It does add a layer of indirection and hides a bit what\u0027s happening - but does allow projects to define their own validators which is potentially useful to other repositories.\n\nWDYT?\n\n(Other options I rejected is superficially generalizing this - like still looking at the filenames but not their paths - and going up the tree to find a pretty_print.py - which doesn\u0027t really make it less Chromium specific in practice.)",
