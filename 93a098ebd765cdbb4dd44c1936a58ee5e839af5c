      "message": "At first glance, this is worrisome. Yes, the current Dependency class has a lot of stuff in it that isn\u0027t really needed by CipdDependency. But *in theory* a gclient checkout *could* consist of just a single entry which is a cipd dependency. And in the future there may be additional dependency types that we\u0027d like to support generically. So having the \"GClient\" class descend specifically from GitDependency seems like a loss of abstraction.\n\nCan you clarify a bit what the long-term direction here is?",

      "message": "This change doesn\u0027t break that scenario.\nGClient would be a GitDependency, which has a single entry in its \u0027dependencies\u0027 list, which would be a single CIPD dependency, so there is no loss of abstraction.\nSimilarly, if we add another kind of dependency, it would simply be another entry in its \u0027dependencies\u0027 list.\n\nLong term, I want to separate GClient and GitDependency. It doesn\u0027t make sense that the Dependency.__init__ method is called with almost all None and \u0027unused\u0027.\n\nI\u0027m not sure if it should even be a Dependency, since it doesn\u0027t sync anything by itself (only through its dependencies), doesn\u0027t have a parent, name, doesn\u0027t manage an SCM, etc.\nIt just manages a tree of dependencies, and performs actions on them.",

      "message": "Yeah, the fundamental problem here is that the top-level gclient thing can be *represented* by a GitDependency object, but it *isn\u0027t* a GitDependency... it\u0027s its own weird top-level thing.\n\nGlad we\u0027re both looking in the same direction. I think making the top-level wrapper object which manages the set of FooDependencies specified in the .gclient file a totally different kind of object makes total sense.",
