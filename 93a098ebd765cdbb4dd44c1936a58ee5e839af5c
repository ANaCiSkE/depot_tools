      "message": "At first glance, this is worrisome. Yes, the current Dependency class has a lot of stuff in it that isn\u0027t really needed by CipdDependency. But *in theory* a gclient checkout *could* consist of just a single entry which is a cipd dependency. And in the future there may be additional dependency types that we\u0027d like to support generically. So having the \"GClient\" class descend specifically from GitDependency seems like a loss of abstraction.\n\nCan you clarify a bit what the long-term direction here is?",
