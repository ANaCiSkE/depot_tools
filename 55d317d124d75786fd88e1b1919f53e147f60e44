      "message": "Sorry for the late reply here. I\u0027ve been thinking about the right way to do this.\n\nFor the short-term, this LGTM. ðŸ˜Š\n\nBut as we\u0027re improving Siso to be more and more compatible with Ninja and existing developer workflows / tools, I want to let it generate a valid .ninja_log file, too.\n\nI\u0027ve been thinking of a few possible conditions to catch it, but I think it might be easiest if we just write explicit marker files from autoninja and check for them. What do you think about this idea?",

      "message": "The trouble with autoninja writing explicit marker files is that it is a bit more fragile, since a developer might run autosiso, siso ninja, or ninja directly.\n\nIf .siso_deps is always generated by siso then the correct detection would be that it\u0027s a siso build if .siso_deps exists, it\u0027s a ninja build if .ninja_log exists and .siso_deps doesn\u0027t.\n\nOr, siso could have a different first line for .ninja_log (we\u0027d have to teach various tools to accept that).\n\nIt would be _great_ for siso to generate a .ninja_log file.",
