      "message": "Sorry for the late reply here. I\u0027ve been thinking about the right way to do this.\n\nFor the short-term, this LGTM. ðŸ˜Š\n\nBut as we\u0027re improving Siso to be more and more compatible with Ninja and existing developer workflows / tools, I want to let it generate a valid .ninja_log file, too.\n\nI\u0027ve been thinking of a few possible conditions to catch it, but I think it might be easiest if we just write explicit marker files from autoninja and check for them. What do you think about this idea?",
