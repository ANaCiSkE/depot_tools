      "message": "Hi, Bruce! The Nest/Chromecast team noticed their builds using `autoninja` have been unusually slow recently, and I traced it to the fact that the script autodetects builds to accelerate by looking for `use_goma` and `use_remoteexec` in the gn flags. Our builds use a buildflag called `use_rbe` instead; if we add a regex matching this to this script, it speeds up our builds again.",
