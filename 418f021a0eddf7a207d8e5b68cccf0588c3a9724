      "message": "The check has a trailing backslash, which makes it succeed for directories but not files.\n\nI just encountered it in our build setup, where we use a helper repo that has depot_tools as a git submodule (and have for a long time, on multiple platforms). It is not super important since I can work around it, but I thought I should at least leave a record is someone else runs into the same problem. Also, the fix is rather easy, if you don\u0027t mind supporting a .git file too, since the trailing backslash can just be removed.\n\nI can certainly create a real ticket if you find it worthwhile. Thanks for the feedback!",
