      "message": "Hey Gavin! could you help with the change?\n\nreason why I made it is: I use git hooks to run a lot of stuff on every commit (things like code formatting, static analysis, gn deps tracking, iwyu etc) so that I don\u0027t learn about these issues from presubmit (or don\u0027t have to do these manually). Sadly, this Windows hack is breaking it every time I sync.\n\nOptionally: do you know whether this hack is still needed? perhaps it could be removed. it\u0027s been 6 years..\n\nthank you for your help!",
