It might make sense to split some test files (like gclient_tests.py and gclient_smoketest.py).\n\n\u003e Do you have an example of a timeout failure right now?\n\nExample failure:\nhttps://ci.chromium.org/p/infra/builders/try/Depot%20Tools%20Presubmit%20(win)/b8886096598813714800?\n\n\u003e Are we timing out after 30 min?  How did you come up with 3 min?\n\nRight now, the presubmit step times out after 8 minutes.\ne.g. https://ci.chromium.org/p/infra/builders/try/Depot%20Tools%20Presubmit%20(win)/b8886267166188418336?\nNotice that it doesn\u0027t say what test timed out, or what failed, so it is not useful at all.\n\n\u003e How did you come up with 3 min?\n\nI went over the execution times of each test, and picked a nice number that was above it.",
