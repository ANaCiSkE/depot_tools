I like this better, it will actually keep the full history.\n\nI\u0027ve disabled `delayedexpansion` after the required block to not break something down the road.\n\nAlso tested the issue a little. Turns out it is triggered even without  enabledelayedexpansion . When a multiline comment starting with  ::  is written inside an IF/FOR block with  ()  on the second line, CMD doesn\u0027t work well:\n```\n:: line 1 test\n:: line 2 () test    \u003c-- this is fine\n:: ()                \u003c-- this is also fine\nIF 1 \u003d\u003d 1 (\n  :: line 1 test\n  :: line 2 () test  \u003c-- this is bad\n)\nIF 1 \u003d\u003d 1 (\n  :: line 1\n  :: ()              \u003c-- this is also bad\n)\n```",
