      "message": "I assume that that works, but I\u0027m unsure of how we are going to get off of Python 2 if it is the default, even when a script has a Python 3 shebang. The run_on_python2\u003dTrue argument is two functions removed from the call site, and it behaves differently from run_on_python3\u003dTrue (which requires a compatible shebang).\n\nI am not an expert in the area of this code, but I guess I am unclear as to why we would _ever_ want to run a script on both Python 3 and Python 2 at this point.",
