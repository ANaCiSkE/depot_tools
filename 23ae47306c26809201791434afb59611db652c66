      "message": "Still WIP - the templates use relative git paths, and I believe I need to switch to absolute paths to use a manually installed Git if it exists. The absolute posix path needs work.\n\n@sokcevic@chromium.org who made the most recent change to `bootstrap.py`: do you have any tips on testing these changes? The testing instruction in `bootstrap/README.md` says to run `gclient version`. This updates `depot_tools` to `main`, and so my changes to `bootstrap.py` are not used. Would be great to get your advice on how to verify this.",

      "message": "I think the approach looks good.\n\nAs for testing:\n\nset envvar DEPOT_TOOLS_UPDATE to 0\nthis prevents depot_tools from updating and interfering with your change\n\nThen, run `bootstrap\\win_tools.bat` to update your Git template. Then, run any operations, including gclient.\n\nThings to test:\n* existing installs with no system git - a warning should be printed after win_tools.bat\n* existing installs with a system git - a warning should be gone once win_tools.bat is executed\n* new install",
