      "message": "I believe there are three cases here. For the status quo (before this CL):\n\n- Squash mode (the de-facto workflow)\n  - Initial upload adds change desc hashtags.\n  - Further uploads does not add change desc hashtags.\n- No-squash mode without branch, with detached HEAD (similar to the internal Mercurial workflow)\n  - All uploads add change desc hashtags from the current commit to all CLs in the upload.\n- No-squash mode with branch\n  - I don\u0027t know, but I suspect this is identical to no-squash mode without a branch, as (from my understanding) `GetIssue()` returns None in no-squash mode.\n\nWith this CL, no-squash users can opt to use `--bypass-hashtags` to avoid adding hashtags after the initial upload.\n\nIf we always choose not to add change desc hashtags when using no-squash, then the hashtags will never be added. For example, this CL wouldn\u0027t have `git-cl` if that was the case. This is minor functionality (subsequent uploads for no-squash users do not add hashtags) for an extra flag, so if you are opposed to this I\u0027m happy to change this to use `options.squash` instead of `options.bypass_hashtags`. `--no-squash` users would need to manually add hashtags in that case.\n\nFWIW, we have a similar issue for watchlists, so my personal workflow is to use `git cl upload --no-squash HEAD^` for initial uploads, and `git cl upload --no-squash HEAD^ --bypass-watchlists --bypass-hashtags --bypass-hooks` for subsequent uploads (after running `git cl presubmit -u -f HEAD^` for each commit to be uploaded).",
