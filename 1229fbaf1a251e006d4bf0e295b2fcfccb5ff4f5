      "message": "I seem to have only touched Python 3 support here. That said, this having to handle lists of strings seems dubious and I would expect other output wrappers to have failed on this before. Shouldn\u0027t only the final fully formatted output string end up here? What\u0027s passing in or creating the lists?",

      "message": "The lists of strings are happening in Python 3 presubmits, but it\u0027s hard to tell which ones because the call stack was just generic printing of results. The arrays often have a half-dozen or so empty strings and then a string with an actual error message. I could grab some of those actual error messages to try to understand things better (but each run takes an hour or so :-)\nWhen I saw that the write function already handled bytes being passed I thought that maybe passing a list was also considered normal and appropriate. Note also that in the Python 2 case these lists would be handled by the str(text) expression. It may be that this bug has been latent for a long time and was then triggered by the switch to Python 3, which doesn\u0027t contain this conversion.",
