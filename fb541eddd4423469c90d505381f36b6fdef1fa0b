Are you sure that you\u0027re running this in a way where cipd is not using the cached binary?\n\nI thought that constrained language mode forbid things like `[System.IO.File]::*`. When I run the ps1 script locally w/ Constrained Language mode, I see:\n\n```\nLine |\n 177 |      $CipdLockFile \u003d [System.IO.File]::OpenWrite($CipdLockPath)\n     |      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n     | Cannot invoke method. Method invocation is supported only on core types in this language mode.\nInvalidOperation: /s/depot_tools/.cipd_impl.ps1:177\n```",
