      "message": "Agreed. I\u0027ll use the leading underscore as well.\nAdditionally, the coding standard says \"do not abbreviate by deleting letters within a word\" so I\u0027m changing \"dup\" to \"duplicate\".\nFurther, I think it is more descriptive for the name to be \"_allow_duplicate_vs_installs\" instead of \"_allow_duplicate_installs\".\n\nI recognize the coding standard says not to use abbreviations, and \"vs\" violates that. But given how ubiquitous \"win\", \"vc\", and \"vs\" are in this file I think this is an acceptable exception.\n\nHappy to change if you have another preference.\n\n\n\n\"ALLOW_DUP_INSTALLS\" followed the style of the above lines, which are also globals set by the command line parser.\n\nPython is one of my weaker languages.\nIn Ruby, false is a special instance of FalseClass. In Java, common integer values (typically -128 to 127) are cached in boxed form such that Integer a \u003d 1; Integer b \u003d 1; assert(a\u003d\u003db);.\nIt looks like in Python, False is also a special instance.\n\nPerhaps those other lines should be changed to also follow _this_style. But maybe because they are initialized to None instead of a special instance, the constant guideline is different? I don\u0027t know enough to have a solid answer to that.\n\nI\u0027ll create a separate CL that changes them and we can weight out the idea there.",

      "message": "I only really looked-at/thought-about SUPPORTED_VS_VERSIONS and that global is an actual constant, and should be UPPER_CASE. The others are non-const and should be lower_case. Changing the case will actually improve clarity by making the constant more obviously a constant, so that will be a good change to make. One coding-standard rule is to copy the local style even if it violates the coding standard, so it\u0027s not a slam dunk, but I think it makes sense in this case.\n\nvs and vc as abbreviations seem reasonable. I think that \"sufficiently common\" acronyms and initialisms get a buy.",
