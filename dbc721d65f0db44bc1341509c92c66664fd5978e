      "message": "I would recommend to add new gclient configs directly in the module that uses them to keep related code close together. This also eliminates the need to create a separate CL. This can be achieved by creating gclient_config.py inside your recipe module and the recipe engine will know that it should be used to extend this config when your recipe module is used.\n\nLeaving up to you if you want to keep using this one or move it to gclient_config.py in your recipe module.",
