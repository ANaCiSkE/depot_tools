      "message": "The last time I touched this it was pretty rickety. It wouldn\u0027t surprise me that it\u0027s completely defunct at this point.  In theory \u0027make_docs\u0027 is supposed to be hermetic, but I don\u0027t think it was every terribly robust.\n\nIt\u0027s also possible that git itself (and also the various depot_tools git addon commands) has changed sufficiently so that the \u0027demo\u0027 scripts need touchup. If you want to rehabilitate this (and I think that would be great!) I\u0027d be happy to have a GVC and give a brain dump of how it\u0027s supposed to work and how it may be tuned up.\n\nIf not... you probably also want to just do a raw s/master/main in the generated pages for now :)",
