      "message": "The bash file achieves a couple things:\n1. Runs `cipd_bin_setup.sh` to ensure the cipd dependency is already downloaded.\n2. We can pass default flags/performance optimization configs within this by default.\n\n`vpython`, for example, does something similar. You think we should directly use it from `.cipd_bin`?",

My concern is that depot_tools already provides many scripts, and we should be careful adding more. If engineers start to rely on gcloud, it could make upgrades more complicated.\n\nI\u0027d rather focus on making gsutil.py work with `gcloud storage` without exposing gcloud directly.",
