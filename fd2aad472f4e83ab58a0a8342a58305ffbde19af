We should also handle the case where owned_by_all_users is True and return \u0027*\u0027.\n\nThough Gerrit seems to be still returning random users even though resolve-all-users\u003dFalse. Could you confirm and file a bug if that\u0027s the case?\n\nhttps://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/code-owners/+/refs/heads/master/resources/Documentation/rest-api.md#list-code-owners-for-path-in-branch",
