      "message": "So, turns out that there were issues - probably hidden by the fact that the PRESUBMIT files I was usually triggering in my \"daily usage\" testing didn\u0027t have any post-submit hooks.\n\nLuckily the unit tests (which I didn\u0027t know existed before hitting CQ+2 - didn\u0027t occur to me to look into a subdirectory, lol) caught them.\n\nSo I\u0027ve fixed the issues (I had forgotten to pass gerrit_obj) and for consistency I\u0027ve made the PresubmitExecuter and \"GetPostUploadExecuter\" more similar in their interface.\n\nAlso added unit tests for this.\n\nPTAL at the new version - thanks! :-)",
