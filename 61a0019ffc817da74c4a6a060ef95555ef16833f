      "message": "1) I think enforced_os is a list of deps_os values; that\u0027s probably the wrong thing to use here?\n\n2) I\u0027d prefer it we didn\u0027t use \"gclient_\" in the variable names; that feels implied to me.\n\n3) I\u0027d also prefer it if we used the same values we use in GN, so that they are compatible and we don\u0027t have to map things across. The primary implication of this is that we\u0027d use \"linux\" instead of \"unix\", which is a bit weird since we use \"unix\" for deps_os now, but I think it\u0027s the right thing to migrate to.\n\nDo you have any strong leanings on the latter two things?",

      "message": "1) It\u0027s a list (tuple), yes. I\u0027ve been thinking what would be best to use, but enforced_os seemed the best one available. Do you have a specific suggestion what to use otherwise? Should we add something new, and if so, how should it interact with enforced_os (if at all)? It\u0027d make sense to add an independent similarly detected value.\n\n2) Fine, although if we emit it this way to GN it may conflict with variables defined on the GN side. Not sure if that\u0027s intended.\n\n3) Is there a list of GN values somewhere? Please note either way something is not going to match something else, so in a way this is an arbitrary tradeoff. I\u0027m fine with you picking one of the options.",
