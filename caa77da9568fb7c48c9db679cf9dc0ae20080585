If it\u0027s an `or`, we chose the one we\u0027re using and list only that one, not both. If it\u0027s an `and`, it should be comma separated to denote that both licenses apply. Was there a specific reason you wanted to get rid of this?\n\nhttps://buganizer.corp.google.com/issues/300466236#comment5",
