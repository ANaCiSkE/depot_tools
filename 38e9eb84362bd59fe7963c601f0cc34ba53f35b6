      "message": "The issue is that we catch the keyboard interrupt in ninja.py[1] and instead return a exit code of 1. This means that a string of `\u0026\u0026` will end if ninja returns a non zero exit code or is interrupted.\nSee my minimal repro here https://bit.googleplex.com/#/bentekkie/6137299328827392\nIf `and.sh` is killed via ctrl-C during the loop in `code.py`, after is not printed\nBut `always.sh` always prints after even if it is killed via ctrl-C during the loop in `code.py`\n\n[1] https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/tools/depot_tools/+/main:ninja.py;drc\u003d22bbba13ce1aab365a1f451faecdd0557580698c;l\u003d87",
