I\u0027d like to avoid updating the README every time we find another good piece of innocuous, anonymous data to collect. For example, to debug slow git push times I suspect we\u0027ll want to collect data on how far behind master the uploaded commit is, because that seems to anecdotally at least correlate with slowness.",
