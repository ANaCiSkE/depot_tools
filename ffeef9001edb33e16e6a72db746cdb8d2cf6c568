      "message": "No, this definitely changed behavior for jobs that don\u0027t set set_output_commit. This commits adds ref information, e.g. refs/heads/main@{#123}, and that\u0027s used as commit. This landed around 2022-04-05 10:30 PM (PDT) for v8 builder. However, the change was reverted due to issues with chromeos builders. That\u0027s why you see old behavior after 2022-04-07 7:59 PM (PDT).\n\nIf you would like refs/heads/main@{#123} as commit; then you can set set_output_commit\u003dTrue in v8 recipe.",
