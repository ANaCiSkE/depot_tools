It was introduced for OWNERS before gerrit owners plugin, and that\u0027s no longer required.\n\nSo, there\u0027s some dead code in depot_tools that can be cleaned up, and this should go away with that too.",

I\u0027m concerned we will end up implementing entire diffing logic, which may be very tricky.\n\nHave you looked into difflib, and is it applicable here?\n\nOther options could include requiring additional data to be provided, e.g. original file contents as well as the latest.",
