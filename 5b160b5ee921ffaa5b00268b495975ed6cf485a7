      "message": "Why are dedicated methods preferable to just calling these like api.gerrit([\u0027command\u0027, ...])? In most of the other methods here, they are doing extra work, like error checking or returning some sort of processed data, but that doesn\u0027t seem to be the case here. I guess it does avoid having to lookup the command-line flags, but that\u0027s not a huge advantage.\n\nIf you\u0027re really looking to simplify things for users, then it might be more interesting to provide a single method to create/edit/publish the change change all at once, maybe something like:\n\n  update_file_in_gerrit(host, project, branch, repo_file_path, new_file_contents, commit_msg)\n  \nor to support multiple files at once:\n\n  update_files_in_gerrit(host, project, branch, dict_of_file_paths_and_new_contents, commit_msg)\n\nWDYT?",
